# log4j2-elasticsearch-core
Core provides a skeleton for `ClientObjectFactory` implementations: a set of interfaces and base classes to push logs in batches to Elasticsearch cluster. By default, FasterXML is used generate output via `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.JsonLayout`.

## Extensibility

Main parts of the skeleton are:
* `ClientObjectFactory` - provider of client-specific request classes, factories and error handlers
* `BatchEmitter` - intermediate log collector which will trigger batch delivery as configured (see below).

### AsyncBatchDelivery

`AsyncBatchDelivery` uses `ClientObjectFactory` objects to produce client specific requests and deliver them to cluster via `BatchEmitter` implementations.

### BatchEmitter

`BatchEmitterFactory<T extends BatchEmitter>` implementations are located using `java.util.ServiceLoader`. `org.appenders.log4j2.elasticsearch.BulkEmitter` is the current default implementation.

## Configurability

### Delivery frequency
Delivery frequency can be adjusted via `AsyncBatchDelivery` attributes:
* `deliveryInterval` - millis between deliveries
* `batchSize` - maximum (rough) number of logs in one batch

Delivery is triggered each `deliveryInterval` or when number of undelivered logs reached `batchSize`.

`deliveryInterval` is the main driver of delivery. However, in high load scenarios, both parameters should be configured accordingly to prevent sub-optimal behaviour. See [Indexing performance tips](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/indexing-performance.html) and [Performance Considerations](https://www.elastic.co/blog/performance-considerations-elasticsearch-indexing) for more info.

### Message output
There are at least three ways to generate output
* (default) JsonLayout will serialize LogEvent using Jackson mapper configured in log4j-core
* `messageOnly="true"` can be configured set to make use of user provided (or default) `org.apache.logging.log4j.message.Message.getFormattedMessage()` implementation
* custom `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.AbstractStringLayout` can be provided to appender config to use any other serialization mechanism

### Failover
Each unsuccessful batch can be redirected to any given `FailoverPolicy` implementation. By default, each log entry will be separately delivered to configured strategy class, but this behaviour can be amended by providing custom `ClientObjectFactory` implementation.

## Dependencies

### Provided
Be aware that Jackson FasterXML jars that has to be provided by user for this library to work in default mode.
